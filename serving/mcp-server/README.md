# Modern Web MCP

An Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to modern web development best practices, guides, and baseline browser support data.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Search for web development patterns and guides using natural language.
- **Best Practices**: Retrieve curated implementation guides for common web UI components (e.g., tooltips, carousels).
- **Baseline Support**: Check browser compatibility and "Baseline" status for web features.
- **Operational Guide**: Includes an `AGENTS.md` guide for AI agents to follow strict operational rules.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher recommended)
- `pnpm`

### 1. Install Dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Build & Initialize Database

This project uses a local **LanceDB** vector database to power its semantic search capabilities. The database is built from the source markdown guides located in `src/guides`.

You **MUST** run the build script before starting the server. This script does two things:
1.  Generates the vector embeddings and populates `/.mcp-data/`.
2.  Compiles the TypeScript code to `/build`.

```bash
pnpm run build
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you skip this step, the server will fail to start or return empty search results because the vector database will be missing.

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Testing Semantic Search

You can test the semantic search capabilities using the demo script:

```bash
pnpm dlx tsx scripts/demo-search.ts "fading in and growing an image as the user scrolls down"

# 🔎 Searching for: "fading in and growing an image as the user scrolls down"
#
# Vectorizing query...

```

```bash

```

```bash

# 🔎 Searching for: "showing a tooltip when hovering over a button"

#
# 2. [color-systems] (ui) - Distance: 1.3888
#    Create dynamic, accessible color systems using modern color syntax and relative colors
```

## Development

To run the server in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Usage

Configure your MCP client to use the locally-built server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Modern Web": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/modern-web-mcp/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Hypothetically, this server could be published to npm and immediately used via `pnpm dlx`, with no build step required:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Modern Web": {
      "command": "pnpm",
      "args": [
        "dlx",
        "modern-web-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

_Note that the pnpm dlx approach will not work today! This is just for illustration purposes._

## Releasing Updates

For now, this project is under active development and is not yet published to npm. However, if and when it is published, it's configured to publish the **pre-built vector database** to npm. This allows users to run the server via `pnpm dlx` immediately without needing to build the database locally.

### How to Publish

1.  **Pull latest changes**: Ensure you have the latest markdown guides.
    ```bash
git pull origin main
    ```
2.  **Publish**:
    ```bash
pnpm publish
    ```
    *   The `prepublishOnly` script will automatically run `pnpm run build` to regenerate the vector database in `.mcp-data/` and compile the code.
    *   The `files` allowlist in `package.json` ensures that `.mcp-data/` and `build/` are included in the tarball, while `src/` is excluded.
## Architecture

- **`src/guides/`**: Source markdown files containing web development patterns.
- **`scripts/build-guides.ts`**: The build script that parses guides, generates embeddings, and updates the LanceDB instance.
- **`.mcp-data/`**: The local directory where the LanceDB vector store is persisted (gitignored but published to npm).
- **`build/`**: The directory where the compiled code is stored (gitignored but published to npm).
- **`AGENTS.md`**: Operational instruction file for AI agents.
