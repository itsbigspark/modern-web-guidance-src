# Guidance Project Context for Agents

You are working in the `guidance` monorepo, which defines and evaluates modern web development best practices.

## Rules of Engagement

- **AI-first development**: Assume all code will be written and maintained by LLMs, not humans. Optimize for model reasoning, regeneration, and debugging — not human aesthetics.
- **Flattened MCP**: The MCP server code lives in `serving/mcp-server/`. Do not create a `src/` directory there.
- **Guidance is Truth**: The markdown files in `serving/mcp-server/guides/` are the source of truth for the MCP's knowledge.
- **Monorepo**: This is a pnpm workspace. Run all installs and project-wide scripts (e.g., `pnpm run preflight`) from the root.
- **Modern Web**: Prefer native browser APIs (Popover, CSS Anchor Positioning, View Transitions) over third-party libraries.
- **TypeScript**: Strictly use ESM and `.js` extensions for imports in TypeScript files to support erasable syntax.

## Project Structure

- **`serving/`**: The Modern Web MCP server.
  - `mcp-server/guides/`: **Source of truth for implementation guidance.** Add or edit markdown files here to update what the MCP server knows.
  - `mcp-server/data/`: Generated data, including the vector-ready use-case registry.
  - `scripts/`: Utilities for building the vector store and testing search.
- **`harness/`**: The Guidance eval harness.
- **`eval-view/`**: The eval dashboard for viewing eval results.
  - `checks/`: Logic for scoring AI-generated code.
  - `setup/`: Templates and scenarios used for testing.

## Operational Rules

1. **Workspaces**: This is a `pnpm` workspace. Always run `pnpm install` from the root.
2. **Updating Guidance**: If you modify files in `serving/mcp-server/guides/`, you **MUST** run `pnpm build:mcp` to regenerate the vector database (`.mcp-data/`).
3. **Testing**:
   - Serving: `pnpm test:mcp`.
   - Evaluator: `pnpm autorun`.
